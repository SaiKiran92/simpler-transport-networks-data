# simpler-transport-networks-data
TNTP data converted into CSV format.

Original data can be found [here](https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks).

Did this because some might find it easier to read the data in CSV format. But parser functions in Julia are also added. Could be customized for any other TNTP data.

Note that not all the data is added from the original repository. That'll probably take some time.
